# README

Ruby practice along with a video creating an app in Ruby. This was a great foray into Ruby as I got experience with MVC architecture, Ruby programming, Rails serverside setup, environment setup. My plan is to recreate this more and more over time so that I can get comfortable working in Ruby on Rails.

Functionality includes:

* Ruby version 3.0.0
* System dependencies
* Configuration
* Database creation
* Database initialization
* How to run the test suite
* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
* Deployment instructions
